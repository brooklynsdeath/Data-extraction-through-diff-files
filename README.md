# Data-extraction-through-diff-files

1.       File 1: Holdings of  some mutual funds for the last 1 year

2.       File 2: Meta data for the funds

3.       File 3: Daily NAV of the funds for the last 1 year

# TASK
1.       Write a function in Python / SQL to calculate monthly returns using the NAV and make a separate table for the returns

2.       Write a script for the following in Python and save the results in a PANDAS dataframe:

·         Find holdings of all funds in Oct 2020 where the fund type is “Large Cap” and asset is "Domestic Equities"

·         Find the average monthly returns of funds from Mar 2020 to Oct 2020 where fund type is “Mid Cap”

·         Write a function to find the cumulative return for a fund between any 2 months

·         Build a visualization using Seaborn / Matplotlib to find range of performance of all fund types using Python. Based on the range of performance above, which fund type would you suggest to a friend to invest in and why?

·         Any other conclusions of your own would be welcome.
